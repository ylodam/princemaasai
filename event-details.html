Dive courses are offered at many of the hotels and lodges on the mainland coast as well as Zanzibar, Pemba and Mafia islands, and it is a rewarding skill to learn while on holiday, but the surface swimmer need not to despair since most of the reefs are accessible to snorkellers and equipment are easily rented from dive shops and lodges.

									<h4>Trekking Preparation</h4>
								</a>
								 Planning and preparation are crucial to the success of a Kilimanjaro climb!

										

<p align="justify">

And when I say success, I mean not only your chances to reach the summit. Planning and preparation will determine how much you enjoy, or not, the whole trek, from start to finish.Every issue that I mention here is explained in detail on another page, often several pages, but here you can get a good overview of what it takes to climb Mount Kilimanjaro.

<br>

<h3>Planning a Kilimanjaro Climb</h3>

You need to make <strong>three major decisions before you can climb Kilimanjaro:</strong>

<br>

 <strong>You have to decide on a date.<br>

 You have to decide on the climb route and length (how many days/nights).<br>

 You have to decide on a trekking agency/climb operator.</strong><br>

<h3>1. Deciding on a date</h3>

The best times to climb Mt. Kilimanjaro are the driest months of the year, especially Jan/Feb and Aug/Sep. But any time between January and mid March or between June and October offers reasonable chances of good weather on Kilimanjaro.



<br>

<h3>2. Deciding on a climb route and the duration of your Kilimanjaro climb </h3>

<p align="justify">There are several climb routes up Kilimanjaro. They vary in length and difficulty. All except one require you to camp. If you use the Marangu route your accommodation is in huts and camping is not allowed.

<br><br>

Five days is the absolute minimum duration for a Kilimanjaro trek, six is better. For the popular Machame route six days is the minimum, seven days is recommended.

<br><br>

Taking an extra day for acclimatisation will greatly improve your chances to reach the summit. There are longer treks available for those who can afford them.



<br>

<h3>3. Selecting your trekking agency/climb operator</h3>

<p align="justify">Mount Kilimanjaro is protected by the Kilimanjaro National Park. Access is restricted and the steep Kilimanjaro park fees make a Kilimanjaro climb rather expensive.

<br>

But before you go hunting for a cheap Kilimanjaro climb, read the page about the true cost of climbing Kilimanjaro.

<br>

<strong>You can only climb Kilimanjaro with a registered guide/trekking agency</strong>. A good climb operator will supply guides, a cook, porters, food, water, and camping equipment if you are camping.

<br>There is no need, indeed no opportunity, for you to worry about the details. You don't need to carry anything but your day pack, you don't need to cook or put up your tent or anything. You just choose your Kilimanjaro tour operator.

<br>

Most people book their Mount Kilimanjaro climb from overseas. For the majority of climbers this is certainly recommended over selecting a climb operator in the last minute when you get there.

<br>

<strong>The selection of Mt. Kilimanjaro tours to choose from is overwhelming. The quality varies wildly, from irresponsible "cowboy" outfits to luxury climb operators who just about carry you to the top.

</strong><br>

What you should be looking for is a quality and responsible operator who also treats their staff well. 

<strong>Do NOT pinch pennies on Kilimanjaro. Do NOT climb Kilimanjaro with a lower end budget operator.

</strong>

<br><br>



<h2>How to Prepare for you Kilimanjaro Adventure</h2>

You need to do some preparation before you can climb Kilimanjaro:

<br>

 <strong>You need to book your flights.<br>

 You need to organise your visa.<br>

 You need to get the required vaccinations.<br>

 You need to buy or rent the necessary equipment.<br>

 You need to get yourself into shape.<br>



</strong>

<h3>4. Booking your flights</h3>

<p align="justify">If you book your Kilimanjaro trek from overseas then your trekking agency may also organise your Kilimanjaro flight for you. If not, then you have to do that.

<br><br>

The closest airport to Mt. Kilimanjaro is, yep,<strong> Kilimanjaro Airport (JRO)</strong>. Kilimanjaro Airport is situated half way between Arusha and Moshi, and most people land there. <br>

Mt. Kilimanjaro itself is closer to Moshi. Many trekking agencies are located there, though you also find a good number in Arusha. (Arusha is also the "safari capital" of Tanzania and the gateway to Ngorongoro, Serengeti, Tarangire etc.)

<br>

If you are planning an extended Tanzania trip you may also want to fly to/from one of the other main airports in the area: Dar es Salaam, Zanzibar or even Nairobi.

<br>



<h3>5. Organising your visa</h3>

<p align="justify">You need a visa to enter Tanzania and a passport that's valid for at least another 6 months.

<br><br>

If your country of residence does have a Tanzanian embassy, phone them or check their website to find out how to obtain your visa.

<br><br>

If your country does not have a Tanzanian embassy, you can buy a visa upon arrival in Tanzania.

<br>



<h3>6. Getting your vaccinations</h3>

 You may need a yellow fever certificate and there are a number of other vaccinations recommended. Some of them need to be started months in advance, so talk to your doctor soon.

<br><br>

Depending on your travel plans you may also want to take anti-malaria medication. Talk to your doctor about it.

<br><br>

What exactly you need ultimately depends on the length of your stay and other places you may want to visit besides Kilimanjaro, e.g. Zanzibar or going on a safari.

<h3>7. Organising the necessary equipment</h3>

<p align="justify">If you booked with a quality operator then quality camping equipment is included in the price.

<br><br>

Many Kilimanjaro tour operators also offer other gear for rent, gear that you may not want to purchase for one time use only or may not want to lug around Tanzania on an extended trip.

<br><br>

Equipment you can often rent includes down sleeping bags, insulation pads and down jackets.

<br><br>

Beyond that you will also need very good quality, thermal under and upper layers of clothing, gloves, warm hat, good sunglasses, sunscreen (for the lips, too!), a day pack, rain protection for everything, water bottles/camel back and more.

<br><br>

Most importantly you need high quality hiking boots and they need to be well broken in!

<br><br>

										Here is a list of essential Kilimanjaro equipment and here are more tips on packing for Kilimanjaro.



<br>

<h3>8. Getting yourself into shape</h3>

Mt. Kilimanjaro is a popular climb because Kili requires no special expertise or mountaineering equipment. In fact, it is not a climb, it's a hike. You can walk all the way to the top.

									<h4>Packing Guide</h4>
								</a>
								Packing List</h1>

										

										

								<h3>General Packing List</h3>

								<li>In case luggage doesn’t arrive the same day you do, put enough clothing and supplies for
									the first day in your carryon luggage.
								</li>
								
								<li>If taking a domestic flight luggage weight restrictions range between 15-20 kgs (33-44
									lbs) total per person.

									<h4>FAQ</h4>
								</a>
								
								When you book your safari with <b>Prince Maasai Safari Tours and Adventure</b>, we will send you a pre-departure packet with extensive details and important information. In the meantime, here are answers to some frequently asked questions.</p>
								<strong>Q. WHEN IS THE BEST TIME TO GO ON SAFARI?</strong><p>
								Tanzania offers the best and most consistent wildlife viewing opportunities year-round. The dry season (June to October) is generally considered the best time overall for game viewing. However, even the wet season in Tanzania (November to May) has an amazing amount to offer in terms of wildlife viewing. April and May are probably the least optimal months to go since many camps close during the long rains. However, there are still enough places open for us to put together a magnificent itinerary for you if those months are your only option. And, since it is the low season, you will enjoy the benefits of a less crowded and less expensive journey!</p>
								<strong>Q. WHAT TRAVEL REQUIREMENTS ARE THERE?</strong><p>
								Passport<p>
								Your passport must be valid for at least six months on the day you depart from your home country. In addition, your passport must contain at least four blank visa pages that are two sets of two opposing blank visa pages.</p></p>
								Visa<p>
								It is possible to obtain a tourist visa upon arrival at the airports of Dar es Salaam, Kilimanjaro and Zanzibar, and we will provide an expedited visa process but you also have the opportunity to apply for a visa in your home country prior to your trip. It is important to know that you have to pay for the visa in USD dollars and that they only take cash payments upon arrival.</p>
								<strong>Q. ARE THERE ANY MEDICAL REQUIREMENTS TO ENTER TANZANIA?</strong><p>
								It is very important to set an appointment with a travel doctor in your home country before you come. Depending on the situation, you might take vaccine for yellow fever. If you go to Zanzibar or come from (or transit in) an endemic yellow fever country, proof of vaccination against yellow fever may be required at the airport.
								Vaccinations are recommended for travelers going to Tanzania: yellow fever, hepatitis A and a combined tetanus, diphtheria and inactivated polio vaccine (Td/IPV). Proof of Yellow Fever vaccination is required if you are traveling to Tanzania from countries that have Yellow Fever Endemic or travelers who transit in Yellow Fever Endemic Areas, only if the transit period at the airport is 12 hours or more.</p><p>
								Check the CDC’s website for updated health information for travelers to Tanzania. <a href="http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/tanzania">http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/destinations/traveler/none/tanzania</a></p><p>
								If you use prescription medication or if you suffer from a medical condition that requires special consideration, it is best to consult your physician and inform the aircraft company before flying. You may require a medication passport to show authorities abroad and flight attendants that you need certain medication. In the event that you lose your medication or require additional supplies abroad, the medication passport will allow you to refill your prescription. In addition, you will usually need a doctor’s certificate in the form of a Schengen medical certificate or a medical certificate written or translated into English. The same may apply to traveling with medical equipment. Enquiring about these things may take weeks, so it is best to start well in advance.</p>
								<strong>Q. WHAT ABOUT MALARIA?</strong><p>
								There is no vaccine available against malaria. We recommend the use of anti-malarial medication, but again, it is best to take this up with a travel medical specialist. Malaria is an infectious disease that is caused by a parasite. You get it from the bite of a mosquito that carries the parasite. These parasites multiply first in the liver cells and then in the red cells of the blood. The symptoms include shaking chills, followed by fever, usually preceded by flu-like illness. To protect yourself against mosquito bites, you can spray yourself with insect repellent containing DEET and make sure to cover your body properly if you are outside after sunset.</p>
								<strong>Q. DO I NEED TRAVEL INSURANCE?</strong><p>
								Travel insurance is the traveler’s own responsibility. We recommend that you take out travel insurance in your home country that will cover, for instance, loss, damage or theft of luggage, money and other valuables, medical expenses, repatriation expenses, etc. Consider also any additional cover you may need, such as for extreme, specialist or high-risk sports (scuba diving, canoeing, mountain biking, etc.). Mountain climbing requires a separate mountaineering insurance policy. Travel with Us accepts no liability whatsoever in connection with any such activities.</p>
								<strong>Q. WHAT IS TANZANIA'S CLIMATE?</strong><p>
								Situated in the eastern part of the African continent, bordering on the Indian Ocean, Tanzania enjoys mostly warm weather all year round. The climate varies considerably in this large country, but a tropical wet and dry climate, or tropical savanna climate, predominates. The eastern portion of Tanzania has more periods of rainfall and droughts, while Central Tanzania is predominantly very dry. The main rainy season or ‘long rains’ in Tanzania lasts from March until the end of May. This is the time when everything turns vibrant green – a great time to see wildlife! Then, between June and August, it is drier and cooler in Tanzania. The beginning of October marks the start of the period of ‘short rains’ during the daytime, with warm summer temperatures. January, February and March are the driest summer months of the year. As your tour will take you to various altitudes, ranging from mountainous regions to lower coastal areas, temperatures will differ. In view of the different seasons and the fact that it can get a little chilly at night, it is advisable to pack clothes that you can layer easily. </p>
								<strong>Q. WHAT IS TANZANIA'S CURRENCY?</strong><p>
								The local currency is the Tanzania Shilling (TZS). In hotels and restaurants, bills can normally be paid in USD, but in local shops and markets, you will need TZS which is available at most banks and bureaus in major towns. ATMs are available in Dar es Salaam and Arusha, and most major towns, but once you are out on safari (in the bush), you will not have access to either banks or ATMs, so exchange sufficient funds beforehand. Credit cards are normally accepted in the bigger hotels and restaurants, but in the smaller lodges or hotels, there is often no access.</p>
								<strong>Q. HOW DO I DRESS?</strong><p>
								In honor of their religious beliefs and culture, Tanzanian people always dress modestly. In the privacy of your accommodations or at the beach, you do not need to concern yourself with any dress code, but if you mix with the local population, it is appropriate to wear clothes that cover the body, especially shoulders and legs. This is a simple courtesy that shows respect for the local population.</p>
								<strong>Q: WHAT DO I PACK?</strong><p>
								- All necessary documents: passport, vaccine certificate and others that might apply.<br />
								- Any medication you might need: This should include medication for possible common situations like headaches or diarrhea.<br />
								- Sun block, sunglasses, hat, lip balm and moisturizer.<br />
								- Your camera: we recommend bringing a wide lens (about 17-55mm) for those scenery pictures, and a telephoto lens (in the 200-400mm range) to catch animals at a distance.<br />
								- Binoculars: We do provide a pair of top notch binoculars in the vehicle but feel free to bring your own which you may be more used to.<br />
								- Clothes: Comfortable and casual clothing, with khaki, beige or green colors. You should pack t-shirts, shirts with long sleeves, long pants, a sweater and a jacket (for the cold mornings), swimwear (if the accommodations you selected have a pool or if you do a beach extension) and comfortable hiking shoes.<br />
								- Insect repellent</p>
								<strong>Q. WHAT IS INCLUDED IN YOUR TOURS?</strong><p>
								All our safaris include excellent Toyota Land Cruisers adapted for the best safari experience with pop-up roof with unlimited mileage, all national parks entrances, camping and concession fees and permits, unlimited water and soft drinks during the safaris, donations to the local communities and accommodations as agreed (on full board or all inclusive basis).</p>
								<strong>Q: WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE TOURS?</strong><p>
								We do not include the country visas, and items of personal interest like souvenirs or extra services/tours not agreed beforehand. Tips for your guide and lodges are not included. Also, if after you book your tour, the government decides to apply increases in park fees, camping fees, concession fees or others, these shall be added to your contract as well.</p>
